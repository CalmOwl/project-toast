# Toast Component Project

## Joy of React, Project II

In this project, we'll dive deep into the implementation of a single common UI component: A `<Toast>` message component.

## To create new components

```bash
# Create a new component:
npm run new-component [TheNewComponentName]
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any weird errors when trying to run a development server, start by deleting the `.parcel-cache` directory. This directory holds temporary automatically-generated files, and sometimes things get out of sync, and they need to be deleted.

### Cannot Destructure ToastPlayground

Several students have reported getting an error like this, when saving files:

> TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'handleToastAddition' of '(0 , \_reactDefault.default).useContext(...)' as it is undefined

This can happen if you try to pull a value from context when that value hasn’t been provided. Double-check that your Provider component is wrapping around the entire application.

That said, I’ve also heard from some students who have said that they get this error when saving files, despite the fact that everything works correctly when refreshing the page. This appears to be a bug with Parcel, the bundler we’re using in this project. **As annoying as it is, I would encourage you not to worry about this.** In real-world projects, I’d recommend using a full-stack framework like Next.js or React Router 7+, where you won’t run into this issue.

### Other issues

If you're running into other issues, please let us know in Discord. Please include the error message, your environment (browser/OS), and any changes you've made to the code.

Also, please try deleting the `.parcel-cache` directory first, to rule out any cache issues.

## Exercise 3: Toast shelf

One of the core defining characteristics of toast notifications is that they stack!

![Several toasts popping up, one after another](./docs/poppin-toasts.gif)

Your mission in this exercise is to restructure things so that our `ToastPlayground` allows us to create _multiple_ toasts.

To help in your quest, you'll find a `ToastShelf` component in this project. It will automatically apply the styles and animations.

You'll need to replace the `Toast` live demo with this new `ToastShelf` component, inside `ToastPlayground`:

```diff
<header>
  <img alt="Cute toast mascot" src="/toast.png" />
  <h1>Toast Playground</h1>
</header>

- <Toast />
+ <ToastShelf />

<div className={styles.controlsWrapper}>
  <div className={styles.row}>
```

By the end of this exercise, it should look like this:

![Screen recording showing toast messages popping up when “Pop Toast!” is clicked](./docs/toast-exercise-3-demo.gif)

**This is a very tricky exercise.** If you're not sure where to start / how to make this work, I share some [hints on the course platform](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/project-toast/03-hints).

Some lessons that might help, from the course:

- [The onClick Parable](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/02-state/04.02-on-click-parable)
- [Dynamic key generation](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/02-state/07-key-generation)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Instead of live-editing a single Toast instance, the playground should be used to push new toast messages onto a stack, rendered inside `ToastShelf` and shown in the corner of the page.
- When “Pop Toast!” is clicked, the message/variant form controls should be reset to their default state (`message` should be an empty string, `variant` should be "notice").
- Clicking the “×” button inside the toast should remove that specific toast (but leave the rest untouched).
- A proper `<form>` tag should be used in the `ToastPlayground`. The toast should be created when submitting the form.
- **There should be no key warnings in the console!** Keys should be unique, and you should not use the index.

## Exercise 4: Context

As it stands, all of our state has been managed by `ToastPlayground`. This works for our little demo app, but it wouldn't scale well in a real-world application!

In this exercise, we'll refactor our application to use the [“Provider component” pattern](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/04-component-design/08.04-provider-component). It will own all of the state related to the toasts state, and make it available to any child component who requires it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Create a new component, `ToastProvider`, that will serve as the “keeper” for all toast-related state.
  - To generate a new component, you can use the “new-component” script! Try tunning `npm run new-component ToastProvider` in the terminal.
- Components that require the state should pull it from context with the `useContext` hook, rather than passing through props.
- As we saw in the [“Provider Components” lesson](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/04-component-design/08.04-provider-component), we can also share _functions_ that allow consumers to alter the state. Consider making functions available that will create a new toast, or dismiss a specific toast.
- This is a “refactor” exercise. The user experience shouldn't change at all.

## Exercise 5: Keyboard and screen reader support

Our component so far works pretty well for sighted mouse users, but the experience isn't as great for everyone else.

In this exercise, we'll improve the experience for two different groups of people:

- Sighted keyboard users
- Users who use a screen reader

### 5.1: Keyboard users

Let's try something. Pretend that you don't have a mouse or trackpad. Using the keyboard alone, can you create and dismiss a toast message?

**Give it a shot now, in browser.**

**How do I do this?** You'll use the “Tab” key to move focus between interactive elements. You can hold "Shift" and hit "Tab" to move backwards. In order to dismiss the toasts, you'll need to keep tabbing until your focus reaches the close button. Then, hit "Enter".

> NOTE: If you're using Safari or Firefox on MacOS, you'll need to toggle a system setting to allow tabs to focus on buttons. Read more here: https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2014/10/03/link-tabbing-firefox-osx.html

---

Well, what did you think?

I found that this experience was pretty annoying. It was difficult to get the focus to reach the close buttons.

When we built a modal from scratch, we moved focus to within the modal, and trapped it there. This is a good idea for modals (which are urgent and blocking), but it's not the right approach for toasts (which are non-urgent and passive). Moving the user's focus is a pretty aggressive move, and not something we should do unless it's necessary.

**So, here's what we should do:** Let's wire up the "Escape" key to automatically dismiss all toasts.

That way, we aren't interrupting the user. They can read the messages in their own time, and hit "Escape" to dismiss them, without them needing to fuss with tab navigation at all.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Hitting the "Escape" key should dismiss all toasts
- You'll want to do this with a `useEffect` hook, but it's up to you to decide which component should bear this responsibility.

### 5.2: Screen reader users

A screen reader is a piece of software that narrates the page. They're primarily used by folks who are blind or have low vision (though screen readers are also useful for folks with cognitive disabilities).

Understanding how to use screen readers is a bit beyond the scope of this course, so I won't ask you to test things with a screen reader.

Let's imagine we reach out to an accessibility specialist, and they do us the favor of converting our HTML to be screen-reader-friendly.

**Here are the changes we need to make:**

```diff
<ol
  class="ToastShelf_wrapper"
+ role="region"
+ aria-live="polite"
+ aria-label="Notification"
>
  <li class="ToastShelf_toastWrapper">
    <div class="Toast_toast Toast_error">
      <div class="Toast_iconContainer">
        <!-- Variant SVG icon -->
      </div>
      <p class="Toast_content">
+       <div class="VisuallyHidden_wrapper">
+         error -
+       </div>
        Something went wrong! Please contact customer support
      </p>
      <button
        class="Toast_closeButton"
+       aria-label="Dismiss message"
+       aria-live="off"
      >
        <!-- Close SVG icon -->
-       <div class="VisuallyHidden_wrapper">
-         Dismiss message
-       </div>
      </button>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
```

**NOTE: This diff shows the _HTML_.** Pretend that this is an HTML snippet given to you by an accessibility consultant who doesn't know React. Your job is to integrate their suggestions into our React components.

**Curious about these changes?** In the solution video, I'll share exactly why each of these changes are necessary. I realize it probably seems pretty arbitrary right now 😅 but all will be explained in the video.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The `<ol>` should have the specified role / aria tags
- The toast's content should be prefixed with the variant, using the `VisuallyHidden` component.
  - _NOTE:_ The diff above shows an _error_ toast, but the prefix should be dynamic, based on the variant.
- The “Dismiss message” content in the close button should be moved to an `aria-label`. `aria-live` should also be set to "off".

## Exercise 6: Extracting a custom hook

Whew! We've done quite a bit with this lil’ `Toast` component!

In the previous exercise, we added an “escape” keyboard shortcut, to dismiss all toasts in a single keystroke. This is a very common pattern, and it requires a surprising amount of boilerplate in React.

Let's build a **custom reusable hook** that makes it easy to reuse this boilerplate to solve future problems.

There are lots of different ways to tackle this, and there's no right or wrong answer, but here's one idea to get you started: what if we create a new custom hook called `useEscapeKey`?

```js
useEscapeKey(() => {
  // Code to dismiss all toasts
});
```

**This is an open-ended exercise.** Feel free to experiment with different APIs and see what works best for you!

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- We want to create a new generic hook that makes it easy to listen for `keydown` events in React. It's up to you to come up with the best “consumer experience”.
- Because this is a generic hook, it shouldn't be stored with the `ToastProvider` component. Create a new `/src/hooks` directory, and place your new hook in there.
- The `ToastProvider` component should use this new hook.
- **Make sure there are no ESLint warnings.**
  - The easiest way to see ESLint warnings is through the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). With this extension installed, ESLint warnings are shown as squiggly yellow underlines. You can view the warning by hovering over the underlined characters, or by opening the “Problems” tab (`⌘` + `Shift` + `M`, or Ctrl + `Shift` + `M`).
  - If you use another editor, you can search for the ESLint extension. Fortunately, ESLint is very popular, and extensions should exist for all common editors.
